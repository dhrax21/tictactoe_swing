### Summary: Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java

This project implements a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java. The game allows two players to compete against each other in a 3x3 grid. The objective is for one player to place three of their marks (X or O) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row to win the game. The project includes the following key components:

1. **Game Board**:
   - The game board is represented as a 3x3 matrix.
   - Each cell in the matrix can hold a value representing either an empty spot, 'X', or 'O'.

2. **Player Interaction**:
   - The game supports two players who take turns to place their marks.
   - Player inputs are taken through the console, where players enter the row and column numbers to place their marks.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The game checks for a win condition after each move by examining the rows, columns, and diagonals.
   - It also checks for a draw condition when all spots are filled without any player winning.
   - Appropriate messages are displayed to announce the winner or if the game ends in a draw.

4. **Game Flow**:
   - The game starts with an empty board and alternates turns between the two players.
   - After each move, the board state is updated and displayed.
   - The game continues until a win or draw condition is met.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - The game handles invalid inputs, such as out-of-bounds coordinates or attempts to place a mark in an already occupied cell.
   - Players are prompted to re-enter their move in case of invalid input.

### Key Features:
- Simple and intuitive console-based user interface.
- Clear and structured game flow with turn-based mechanics.
- Efficient win/draw condition checking for optimal gameplay experience.
- Robust input validation to ensure smooth gameplay.

### Technologies Used:
- Java programming language.
- Console input/output for player interaction.

This Tic-Tac-Toe game serves as an excellent example of implementing basic game logic and user interaction in Java. It is a fun and educational project for learning fundamental programming concepts and practicing coding skills.
